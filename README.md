Sentiment Analysis on Restaurant Reviews 🍽️📝

📚 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a Sentiment Analysis Model using Deep Learning techniques to classify restaurant reviews as Positive or Negative. The model leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text preprocessing and TensorFlow/Keras for building the classification model.

🚀 Key Features

-Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, Lemmatization, Stopword Removal

-Deep Learning Model: Built using Keras Sequential API

-Model Training: Early Stopping for optimized training

-Performance Metrics: Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

-Interactive Prediction: Real-time sentiment prediction for user-input reviews

🛠️ Tech Stack

-Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

-Numpy, Pandas

-NLTK

-TensorFlow/Keras

-Matplotlib, Seaborn

Model Architecture: Multi-layer Dense Neural Network with Dropout layers


🧠 Model Architecture

-Embedding Layer: Converts text data into dense vectors

-GlobalMaxPooling1D: Reduces dimensionality

-Dense Layers with Dropout: Prevent overfitting

-Output Layer: Binary classification using Sigmoid activatio
